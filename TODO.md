# TODO

- Verify the new UI (`ui/`) matches all features of the previous `MythForgeUIOLD` implementation.
- Remove the `MythForgeUIOLD` references once parity has been confirmed.
- Integrate any remaining backend features required by the updated interface.
- Provide a formal `requirements.txt` listing all Python dependencies.
- Add automated tests for the API and UI.
